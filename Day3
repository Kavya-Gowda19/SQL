Note :1.IN :The IN Operator in SQL is used to specify multiple values/sub-queries in the WHERE clause. It provides an easy way to handle multiple OR condition.
            In general, we can only use one condition in the Where clause, but the IN operator allows us to specify multiple values.
            SELECT * FROM Customers
            WHERE Country IN ('Germany', 'France', 'UK');
            SELECT * FROM Customers
            WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
            SELECT * FROM Customers
            WHERE CustomerID NOT IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Ord

      2.BETWEEN :The BETWEEN operator selects values within a given range. The values can be numbers, text, or dates.
                 SELECT * FROM Products
                 WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;     //WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN #07/01/1996# AND #07/31/1996#; or '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31'

      3.SELECT TOP :The SELECT TOP clause is used to specify the number of records to return.
                    SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
 
                   Not all database systems support the SELECT TOP clause. MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to select a limited number of records
      4.SQL Aliases :SQL aliases are used to give a table, or a column in a table, a temporary name
                    SELECT CustomerID AS ID    //CustomerID ID
                    FROM Customers;  //AS is optional
                   Using "double quotes" for aliases with space characters:
                                                                          SELECT ProductName AS "My Great Products"
                                                                          FROM Products;
 ******5.ON DELETE CASCADE - when a record in the parent table is deleted, all corresponding records in the child table are automatically deleted as well.




            
  **** 9.SQL COMMANDS:
        SQL commands are instructions. It is used to communicate with the database. It is also used to perform specific tasks, functions, and queries of data.      
        SQL can perform various tasks like create a table, add data to tables, drop the table, modify the table, set permission for users.
        Types Of Command:
        There are four types of SQL commands: DDL – Data Definition Language
                                              DQL – Data Query Language
                                              DML – Data Manipulation Language
                                              DCL – Data Control Language
                                              TCL – Transaction Control Language

        1}Data Definition Language:
               DDL changes the structure of the table like creating a table, deleting a table, altering a table, etc.
             - All the command of DDL are auto-committed that means it permanently save all the changes in the database.
             - (6) Create,Alter,Drop,Turnacate,Rename,Comment


             -            Command                                         Description	
                          CREATE	                Create database or its objects (table, index, function, views, store procedure, and triggers)
                                                    CREATE TABLE table_name (column1 data_type, column2 data_type, ...);


                          DROP	                Drop an existing table in a database 
                                                    Drop is uesd to delete both table and attribute
                                                    Example:
                                                    1.DROP TABLE table_name;
                                                    2.ALTER TABLE table_name
                                                      DROP COLUMN column_name;
                                                      note:remove or modify the foreign key constraint - 1.ALTER TABLE child_table DROP CONSTRAINT constraint_name;
                                                                                                           DROP TABLE parent_table;
                                                                                                         2.If you want to delete the table and automatically remove all dependencies, use CASCADE:
                                                                                                            DROP TABLE parent_table CASCADE; //This will delete the table and also remove 
                                                                                                                                                 foreign key constraints from child tables.

                          ALTER	               The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
                                                   -ALTER TABLE table_name                          ALTER TABLE Persons            ALTER TABLE Persons
                                                    ADD COLUMN column_name data_type;               ADD DateOfBirth date;          ALTER COLUMN DateOfBirth year;
                                                   -ALTER TABLE Customers
                                                    DROP COLUMN Email;
                                                   -ALTER TABLE table_name
                                                    RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;



                         TRUNCATE	                The TRUNCATE TABLE statement is used to delete the data inside a table, but not the table itself.	
                                                    TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;
                         COMMENT	                Add comments to the data dictionary	
                                                    COMMENT 'comment_text' ON TABLE table_name;
                         RENAME	                Rename an object existing in the database	
                                                    RENAME TABLE old_table_name TO new_table_name;

                     Parent Table (Referenced by another table)	✅ Works if ON DELETE CASCADE, ❌ Fails otherwise	❌ Fails unless constraints are removed
                     Child Table (References another table)	            ✅ Works	                                                ✅ Works
                     Fastest way to remove all rows?	            ❌ No	                                                ✅ Yes
                note:TRUNCATE TABLE departments CASCADE;   //(But this may delete child table data too!)
                              
           @Difference Between TRUNCATE,DELETE and DROP

                                                  Command	  Removes Data?	Removes Table Structure        Resets Auto-Increment?	Frees Space?
                                                  DELETE	  ✅ Yes (row-by-row)	❌ No	                   ❌ No	             ❌ No (slower)
                                                  TRUNCATE	  ✅ Yes (all at once)	❌ No	                   ✅ Yes	             ✅ Yes (more efficient)
                                                  DROP	  ✅ Yes	            ✅ Yes (completely             ✅ Yes	             ✅ Yes
             //Removes Table Structure:  When you TRUNCATE a table, it removes all the data (rows) inside the table, but the table itself (structure) remains intact

2}  Data Query Language(DQL) 
        -DQL statements are used for performing queries on the data within schema objects.Used To query and retrieve data from a database
        -DQL is mostly centered around the SELECT statement, which is used to fetch data according to specified criteria.
        -SELECT: select retrieves data from one or more tables.
                 SELECT column1, column2, ... FROM table_name;
        -Here’s an overview of the SELECT statement and its common clauses such as WHERE Clause,JOIN Clauses,GROUP BY Clauses,ORDER BY clauses
